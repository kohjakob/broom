# Broom ðŸ§¹

## App for decluttering

1. Take pictures of the belongings you have laying around your room
2. We got a set of questions for you to answer by swiping tinder-style
3. By the way you answer we rank your belongings and suggest stuff to declutter

### Implemented in [Flutter](http://flutter.dev/docs/) with a Clean Architecture [approach](https://resocoder.com/flutter-clean-architecture-tdd/).
